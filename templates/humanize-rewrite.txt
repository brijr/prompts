You will rewrite a draft piece of content to make it feel like it was written by a single, informed person with a clear point of view. The goal is to make it human, specific, and genuinely useful.

Here is the draft you need to rewrite:

<draft>
{{DRAFT}}
</draft>

Before rewriting, examine the draft and plan your improvements in <rewrite_planning> tags inside your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long. Consider:
- Quote specific phrases or sentences from the draft that feel generic or corporate
- For each major section (introduction, main points, conclusion), brainstorm concrete improvements: What specific details, examples, or concrete information could be added?
- Decide what voice/perspective you'll adopt - what kind of informed person would realistically be sharing this knowledge?
- Note what structure would make it most useful to readers

After your planning, rewrite the draft following these guidelines:

**Objectives**
- Be practical and concise; add value, not volume
- Replace abstract concepts with concrete details and clear judgments
- Show real stakes and trade-offs using phrases like "X beats Y when..., but fails if..."

**Voice & Tone**
- Use plain English with contractions and varied sentence length (5-25 words)
- Write as one believable person in a real situation (choose an appropriate role/perspective)
- Avoid corporate speak and buzzwords

**Structure Requirements**
- Hook (1-2 sentences): Start with a scene or specific problem
- TL;DR (1 sentence): Clear summary of main point
- Body (3-6 bullets or short paragraphs): Concrete steps, examples, or arguments
- Finish: End with a checklist or next actions—no generic wrap-up

**Specificity Requirements**
- Include names, dates, numbers, places, and insider details where relevant
- For time-sensitive information, add timestamps like "As of [month/year]..."
- Add 1-2 reputable sources when making factual claims
- Note how to verify uncertain information

**Language Rules**
- Prefer active verbs over noun phrases: use "decide" not "make a decision"
- Keep paragraphs to 4 lines maximum
- Use bullets only when they genuinely save reading time
- Ban these words: indispensable, comprehensive, robust, maximize, leverage, unlock, seamless, utilize, ecosystem, cutting-edge, gateway
- Prefer these words: useful, short, strong, help, use, works, try

**Honesty & Limits**
- Clearly state where the advice doesn't apply
- Explain what to do in those exceptions

**Mandatory Editing Pass**
Before finalizing, you must:
- Cut filler content that doesn't add value
- Remove any sentence that simply repeats a heading
- Replace at least 3 vague terms with specific details
- Break one overly long sentence and merge two choppy sentences
- Read through once and fix any awkward phrasing

Your output should contain only the rewritten piece followed by a 5-item checklist. Do not include meta-commentary about your rewriting process or explanations of changes made, and do not duplicate or rehash any of the planning work you did in the thinking block.

Example output structure:

[Rewritten content with hook, TL;DR, body, and actionable finish]
