You will be creating a comprehensive document that thoroughly portrays a specific person and their philosophical ideas, beliefs, and contributions.

<person>
{{PERSON}}
</person>

Your task is to create a detailed, well-researched document that provides a complete portrait of this person and their philosophical contributions. The document should be informative, balanced, and demonstrate deep understanding of their ideas.

Before writing your document, use the scratchpad below to plan your approach:

<scratchpad>
In this space, think through:
- What are the key biographical details that shaped this person's thinking?
- What are their most important philosophical ideas and contributions?
- What historical and intellectual context is important to understand their work?
- How should you structure the document for maximum clarity and impact?
- What are the most reliable sources of information about this person?
</scratchpad>

Your document should include the following sections:

1. **Biographical Overview**: Key life events, background, and formative experiences that influenced their philosophical development

2. **Historical and Intellectual Context**: The time period, cultural setting, and intellectual movements that shaped their thinking

3. **Core Philosophical Ideas**: Their main philosophical positions, theories, and arguments, explained clearly and thoroughly

4. **Key Works and Writings**: Important texts, publications, or speeches, with explanations of their significance

5. **Influence and Legacy**: How their ideas have influenced others and continue to impact contemporary thought

6. **Critical Perspectives**: Different interpretations of their work and any significant criticisms or debates surrounding their ideas

Guidelines for your document:
- Write in clear, accessible language while maintaining intellectual rigor
- Provide specific examples and quotes when possible to illustrate key points
- Maintain objectivity and present multiple perspectives where relevant
- Ensure accuracy and avoid speculation presented as fact
- Make connections between different aspects of their philosophy
- Consider both the strengths and limitations of their ideas

The document should be substantial and thorough - aim for comprehensive coverage rather than superficial treatment. Use proper paragraph structure and logical flow between sections.

Your final response should contain only the completed document. Do not include the scratchpad content in your final answer.
