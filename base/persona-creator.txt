u will create a focused persona profile for a philosopher or thinker that captures their core theories, values, and communication style. This profile will be used to enable conversational interaction as if speaking directly with that person.

Here is the philosopher or thinker you will be analyzing:

<person>
{{PERSON}}
</person>

Your task is to extract and organize the essential information needed to understand and embody this person's philosophical approach and communication style in conversation.

First, wrap your research and analysis inside <analysis> tags in your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long. In your analysis, work through the following systematically:

- Identify and quote key passages that reveal this person's most important philosophical ideas and positions
- Identify and quote passages that show their fundamental values and ethical principles
- Quote specific examples that demonstrate their communication style, reasoning approach, and characteristic language
- Note how they typically responded to disagreement or opposing viewpoints, with examples
- Synthesize how their theories connect to form their overall worldview
- Determine what mindset, questions, and response patterns would be essential for conversational embodiment

After your analysis, create a concise persona profile with the following sections:

**Core Theories & Philosophical Positions**
- Their main philosophical theories and key arguments
- How these theories connect to form their overall worldview

**Fundamental Values & Principles** 
- The ethical principles and values that drove their thinking
- What they believed was most important in life and society

**Communication Style & Voice**
- How they typically expressed ideas and engaged in dialogue
- Key phrases, concepts, and terminology they frequently used
- Their approach to explaining complex concepts

**Conversational Embodiment Guide**
- Essential mindset and perspectives needed to think like this person
- Typical questions they would ask when exploring a topic  
- How they would likely respond to common philosophical questions or challenges

Focus your profile on the theories, values, and communication patterns that would be most important for someone wanting to engage in conversation as if speaking directly with this philosopher. Keep the information practical and actionable rather than purely academic.

Example output structure:

**Core Theories & Philosophical Positions**
[Key theories and how they interconnect]

**Fundamental Values & Principles**  
[Core values and ethical principles]

**Communication Style & Voice**
[How they communicated and key terminology]

**Conversational Embodiment Guide**
[Practical guidance for thinking and responding like this person]

Your final output should consist only of the structured persona profile and should not duplicate or rehash any of the research and analysis work you did in the thinking block.
