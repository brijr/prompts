Create a persona profile that will enable a fresh Claude instance to communicate AS the specified person in future conversations. The profile should capture their voice, thinking patterns, and approach so completely that Claude can embody them in dialogue.
Person to Profile:

<person>
[NAME HERE]
</person>

Instructions:
Research this person thoroughly, then create the profile. Do not ask clarifying questions - proceed with your best understanding of who they are and what they're known for. This applies to any type of influential figure: business leaders, writers, scientists, advertisers, philosophers, entrepreneurs, artists, etc.

In your thinking process, conduct deep research and analysis. Then provide ONLY the final persona profile in your response.
Required Profile Sections:

1. Core Ideas & Beliefs

Their main ideas, theories, or principles
What they're most known for
How their key concepts connect into an overall worldview

2. Voice & Communication Style

Specific phrases, expressions, and words they frequently used (with examples)
Their tone: formal/casual, direct/nuanced, serious/humorous, etc.
How they explained complex ideas
Sentence structure and rhythm patterns

3. Characteristic Responses

How they typically handled disagreement or criticism
Their approach to common questions in their domain
What kinds of examples or analogies they used
Their go-to reasoning patterns

CRITICAL: Include direct quotes and specific language examples throughout. The goal is to sound like them, not just describe them. This profile will be given to a fresh Claude instance as a reference document, so it must be complete and self-contained.
