You are tasked with creating a comprehensive persona profile for a specific philosopher or thinker that can be used as a practical reference for understanding and embodying their approach to thinking, communication, and problem-solving.

Here is the person you will be analyzing:

<person>
{{PERSON}}
</person>

Your goal is to create a detailed persona profile that goes beyond academic description to provide actionable insights that would allow someone to understand and embody this person's intellectual approach, communication style, and philosophical methodology.

Before creating the persona profile, thoroughly research and analyze this person in <analysis> tags inside your thinking block. It's OK for this section to be quite long. In your analysis:

- Write down key biographical facts, formative experiences, and influences that shaped their intellectual development
- List their major works and extract the core philosophical positions from each
- Examine specific examples of their writing or speaking style - quote particular passages that illustrate how they communicate ideas
- Analyze how they approach different types of problems (logical, ethical, practical, etc.) and what methods they consistently use
- Note how they handle disagreement, criticism, or opposing viewpoints with specific examples
- Identify what makes their perspective unique compared to their contemporaries or predecessors
- Synthesize actionable insights about what someone would need to understand to think or communicate like this person

After your analysis, create a comprehensive persona profile with the following sections:

**1. Core Identity & Background**
- Essential biographical details that shaped their worldview
- Formative experiences and influences

**2. Fundamental Beliefs & Philosophical Positions**
- Their key philosophical stances and principles
- How these beliefs interconnect and form their overall worldview

**3. Thinking & Problem-Solving Approach**
- How they approach complex questions or problems
- Their methodology for reasoning through difficult issues
- Typical thought processes and analytical frameworks they use

**4. Communication Style & Voice**
- How they express their ideas (formal/informal, direct/indirect, etc.)
- Typical phrases, concepts, or terminology they use
- Their approach to explaining complex ideas

**5. Interaction Style**
- How they engage with others in intellectual discourse
- Their approach to disagreement or criticism
- How they build upon or respond to other ideas

**6. Key Works & Signature Ideas**
- Most important contributions with practical explanations
- Signature concepts or frameworks they're known for

**7. Practical Embodiment Guide**
- Specific guidance for someone wanting to think or communicate like this person
- Key questions they would ask when approaching a new topic
- Typical responses or approaches they would take in various scenarios

Make sure your persona profile is:
- Accurate and well-researched
- Practical and actionable for someone wanting to understand or embody this person's approach
- Detailed enough to capture their unique intellectual style
- Written in clear, accessible language
- Focused on what makes this person's approach distinctive and valuable

Your final output should consist only of the comprehensive persona profile and should not duplicate or rehash any of the research and analysis work you did in the thinking block.
